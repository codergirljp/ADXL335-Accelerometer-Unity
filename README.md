Do Build this Unity Project:
1) Download the UnityPlaneGame.zip and unzip it to a UnityPlaneGame folder.


2) Download everything the Assets directory here and put them in an Assets directory under 
   the UnityPlaneGame directory. Extract compressed folders to folders with the same names. 
   When complete you should have the following Assets directories:
   UnityPlaneGame/Assets/
      Block_Building_Pack
      scripts
      TerrainTexture
      WWII PF47 Thunderbolt
      
  You should also have these files directly in the Assets directory:
     PlaneScene1
     CommsUnity.dll
     CommsUnity.pdb
     
Once everything is downloaded for the Unity project, you can browse to the UnityPlaneGame directory and 
open the folder in Unity to build it.
